Manages multiple sports team schedules. Includes shortcodes and widgets to display schedules and a countdown timer to the next game.

== Description ==

Welcome to the MSTW Game Schedules Plugin from [Shoal Summit Solutions](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/).

The MSTW Game Schedules plugin manages multiple sports team schedules including: game dates and times, opponents, locations, results, and links to media (print stories or video on games). It features a countdown timer from the current time to then next game or next home game. Shortcodes and widgets are available to display both the schedule tables and countdown timers.

= NEW IN VERSION 4.0 =
There are SIX NEW FEATURES in the front and back ends of version 4.0:

* Re-purpose data fields via show/hide and re-label display settings
* New schedule slider view (via shortcode) [screenshot-8]
* Supports a complete suite of custom time and date formats via PHP date format strings
* Supports a new team structure which allows the inclusion of team logos in schedule tables and sliders
* Color settings admin screen so the colors of displays can be controlled without editing CSS files
* Display next N games from current date in schedule tables ([shortcode] and widget)

= Front-end features for Website visitors =
The following features enhance the site user experience:

* Schedules (Table) Widget - displays schedules (in tabular format) on pages and posts.
* Schedules Widget - displays (abbreviated) schedule tables in widget-enabled areas.
* Countdown Timer Shortcode - displays countdown timers to the next game on pages or posts.
* Countdown Timer Widget - displays countdown timers in widget-enabled areas.

= Back-end features for Website Admins =
The following plugin features enhance the website admin experience:

* Integration with [Game Locations Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/game-locations/) - makes it even easier to enter game locations and link them to maps and driving directions.
* Unlimited Number of Schedules - may be created, so historical schedules and results can be saved and future schedules can be advertised.
* Import Schedule from CSV Files - allows an administrator to upload schedules from CSV format files.
* Plugin Stylesheet - allows an administrator to style schedule and countdown timers shortcode and widget displays via one simple, well-documented CSS stylesheet (css/mstw-gs-style.css).
* Internationalization - the plugin is fully internationalized (as of v 3.0) and Croatian, Spanish, and Swiss German translations are included with the distribution. (Many thanks to Juraj, Roberto, and Chris!)

= Notes =

* There is no singular post template in this release. A single game view, complete with helmets/team logos and all the information is available in the schedules is planned for version 3.1. It is waiting for the sport and team concepts to be fully fleshed out in the My Sports Team Website (MSTW) Framework.
* The Game Schedule plugin is the second in a set of plugins supporting the My Sports Team Website (MSTW) framework; a framework for sports team websites. Others include Game Locations and Team Rosters, which are both available now on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin called "Game Schedules"? Couldn't I use it for other event schedules? =
Sure. The software doesn't know or care that the entries are "games". The references are to "game schedule" and "sched_games", only because that was original purpose of the plugin. Note however that it has no 'calendar' features, it just provides a simple list of events as a table.  

= Can I set up separate schedules for different teams and/or different seasons? =
Yes. A unique schedule ID defines each schedule. It is the primary argument for shortcodes and the primary option for the widgets. For all practical purposes, you can set up many schedules as you want. So for example schedule 1 could be the varsity in 2012, schedule 2 the JV in 2012, schedule 3 the frosh in 2012, and schedules 4-6 could be the same teams in 2013.

= I live in Split, Croatia (or wherever). Does the plugin support other languages? =
The plugin supports localization as of version 2.0. If you happen to live in Split, you're in luck. A Croatian translation is contained in the /lang directory. (Thanks Juraj!) A Spanish translation was added in version 2.4. (Thanks Roberto!) A Swiss German version is new to version 3.0. (Thanks Chris!) These translation files may need to be updated for version 3.0 and all its new features. A Finnish version will be added to the next release after 3.0, it is in the trunk now. (Thanks Lauri!)

= How do I change the look (text colors, background colors, etc.) of the schedule or the countdown timer? =
In this version you have to edit the plugin's stylesheet, mstw-gs-styles.css. It is located in the game-schedule/css directory. It is short, simple, and well documented. The schedule plugin and the schedule widget have separate sets of styles. The countdown plugin and countdown widget share one set of styles.  In the future, I may provide options for commonly changed styles on the admin page to control the schedule table and countdown timer styles, ala what’s now available in Team Rosters, depending on demand. 

= How do I change the date-time group formats? Day [Month Year is more convenient in Europe.] =
As of version 3.0, seven time and date formats can be customized via the Game Schedules Plugin Display Settings Admin page.

= The formats are right, but my dates and times or the countdown time are not still not correct. What's wrong? =
The date and time displays on both the user and the admin pages as well as the countdown timer are driven by the default WordPress time zone, which is set on the WordPress Settings->General screen. *It is important that you set the correct timezone in the WordPress Settings -> General Settings BEFORE entering any schedule data.*

= What can I do if I have more than three media links? =
If you are that popular, why not create one media link on the schedule that goes to a page of all your links? Or, you can hack the plugin code. I've considered a setting for "number of media links" (the JV and Frosh teams typically have none, at least in San Diego), but that's low on my list right now.

= Can I display more than one schedule on a single page by using multiple shortcodes? =
Yes. As of version 1.1 you can display multiple schedule tables and countdown timers on a single page using the [shortcodes].

= All my data for a game got "zero'ed out", what happened? =
Either: 

* You used the "Quick Edit" link in the list of all games (prior to version 2.0). Install version 2.0 or don't do that!
* You edited a game, updated it, and when you exited the game editor, it asked if you really wanted to leave the page because there were unsaved changes. Knowing that you already saved the changes, you clicked on "leave this page". Wrong! In this case you may not know best, just stay on the page and save the game again.
* You entered some really bad data for a game. Prior to version 3.0, the plugin was particularly sensitive about the time format. (Install version 3.0. This is fixed!)

= I keep getting weird error messages on the page with the sort code. Any idea what's up?  =
These messages were caused by bad date-time data, and should be fixed in version 3.0. If you’re seeing such messages, please upgrade. If everything seems to be working okay except for these annoying error messages, you might want to turn them off on your WordPress site. To do so, edit wp-config.php and add the following lines:
  
> `error_reporting(0);`

> `@ini_set(‘display_errors’, 0);`

otherwise Wordpress overwrites the ALERTS set by PHP.INI`

= 3.0 =
A MAJOR upgrade adding significant functionality requested by users:

* Several admin settings pages were added.
* The number of games displayed in a schedule ([shortcode] or widget can now be set.
* A date range can now be set for the games displayed in a schdule [shortcode] or widget can now be set.
* The plugin is now integrated with the Game Locations plugin. Game locations can be entered to game schedules from a pulldown list of locations in the Game Locations plugin. A link to the location in Google Maps is automatically added.
* Changed the current time to get the WORDPRESS time instead of the SERVER time as was the case previously.
* Changed the actual countdown time (time to next game) construction due to some 'anomalies' with the previous version.

= 2.4 = 
* Fixed a bug prevented "TBD dates" from displaying properly (and producing php warnings in some cases).
* Added a Spanish translation. Thanks to Roberto in Madrid.


= 2.3 = 
Fixed a bug (related to translation) that was causing dates to drift a month off in the shortcode table display.

= 2.2 =
* Changed date() to mstw_date_loc() - forgot a column in the shortcode.
* Added $mstw_gs_time_format to support changing the date format on the schedule table [shortcode].
* Updated the Croatian translation. 

= 2.1 =
* Added the option for a link from a game's location field (displayed in the shortcode table and the countdown widget) to a specified URL.
* Corrected a typo that make the new links on opponent entries not work in every scenario.
* Fixed several bugs in the stylesheet and how it loads (enqueues).

= 2.0 =
* Schedules can now go across multiple years. Schedules are now identified only by the ID, instead of ID and year (as in previous versions). The year field is now simply a part of the game date.
* Added internationalization for the user interface only, not the admin pages. Provided a default .po file in the /lang directory for any would be translators out there, and a Croatian translation (in the mstw-loc-domain-hr_HR.po file).
* Added a setting to countdown timer widget and an argument to the countdown timer shortcode that tells the countdown timer to use home games only.
* Added team links. You can specify a URL for each game. The schedule table shortcode (not widget) will add a link to the specified URL on the opponent name.
* Removed the "current time" field in the widget and argument in the shortcode. This was used only for testing and is not really needed. (There are other ways to test.)
* Removed Quick Edit link from the editor. (It broke things and was unnecessary.) 

= 1.1 =
* Expanded the media URL input fields to maxlength 255. (Some media outlets have long URLs.)
* Corrected bug so that multiple schedules (shortcodes) can be now displayed on one page.
* Added a custom header for wordpress.org

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.

== Upgrade Notice ==

The current version of Game Schedules was developed and tested one WP 3.5.1. If you use older version of WordPress, good luck! Much of the plugin was developed on 3.4.x so that could work okay. If you are using a newer version of WP, please let me know how the plugin works, especially if you encounter problems.

Upgrading to this version of Game Schedules should not impact any existing schedules. (But backup your DB before you upgrade, just in case. :) **NOTE that it will overwrite the css folder and the plugin's stylesheet - mstw-gs-styles.css.** So if you've made modifications to the stylesheet, you may want to move them to a safe location before installing the new version of the plugin.
